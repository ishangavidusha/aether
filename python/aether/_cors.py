"""Cross-origin resource sharing.

    app = App(cors=CORS(allow_origins=["https://app.example.com"]))

Applied in Rust, to every response the server sends — including the `404`,
`413`, `503` and `504` it answers without waking a worker, which a middleware
would never see. A preflight is answered in Rust too.

`allow_origins` is the decision that matters and has no default. Methods and
request headers default to any, because permitting them does not widen what a
foreign site can do once its origin is allowed; the origin list and
`allow_credentials` are the boundary.
