"""In-process pub/sub topics.

A topic is a named fan-out point. Producers emit, subscribers iterate:

    topic = app.topic("orders")

    await topic.emit({"id": 1})

    async for order in topic.subscribe():
        ...

Subscribers on *different* worker loops all receive every message. That works
because free-threaded CPython lets those loops share one process, which is the
whole reason D-002 targets 3.14t. Under a multiprocess server each worker would
hold its own private copy of every topic and a message emitted in one would
never reach the others.

**Why this is Python and not Rust.** The rest of the hot path is Rust because
tokio threads must never touch the interpreter. That argument does not apply
here: both ends of a topic are already Python, so moving the buffer into Rust
would add an FFI crossing on emit *and* on receive to replace a deque operation
that is cheaper than the crossing itself.

Waking a subscriber costs a `call_soon_threadsafe` only when it is actually
idle. A subscriber that is keeping up never blocks, so a busy stream coalesces
naturally, the same principle that made request dispatch fast.
